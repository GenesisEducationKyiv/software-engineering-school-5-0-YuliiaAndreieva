## Context
The weather subscription service requires reliable scheduling for periodic weather updates to subscribers. The service needs to handle two types of update frequencies:
- Hourly updates for subscribers who want frequent weather information
- Daily updates for subscribers who prefer less frequent notifications

---

## Requirements
- Reliability: Scheduled jobs must execute consistently
- Simplicity: Easy to maintain and understand
- Performance: Minimal overhead for scheduling operations

---

## Considered Options

### 1. time.Ticker

Pros:
- Native Go implementation
- Simple to use and understand
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for basic scheduling needs

Cons:
- Limited functionality
- Requires manual handling of concurrency and persistence
- Complex schedule implementation

### 2.github.com/robfig/cron/v3

Pros:
- Cron expression support
- Mature and widely used library
- Active community support
- Simple and intuitive API
- Easy integration with Go codebase

Cons:
- In-memory scheduling (jobs lost on restart)

### 3.System cron

Pros:
- Persistence between restarts
- Centralized management
- Built-in monitoring
- OS-level scheduling
- No application overhead
- Can run scripts or commands in any language

Cons:
- OS dependency
- Complex testing
- Additional system configuration
- Less flexible for Go applications

### 4.AWS Lambda + EventBridge

Pros:
- Fully managed service
- High availability
- Auto-scaling
- Built-in monitoring
- Persistence
- No server management

Cons:
- AWS dependency
- Additional costs

## Decision

Selected: github.com/robfig/cron/v3

The decision to use the cron package was made based on the following factors:
1. Matches current project needs
2. Simple and intuitive API
3. No additional infrastructure required
4. Active community support
5. Easy integration with existing codebase

---

## Consequences

Positive:
- Simple and maintainable codebase
- Low operational overhead
- Easy to understand and modify scheduling patterns
- No additional infrastructure required
- Quick implementation time

### Negative:
- **Jobs are lost if the application restarts**
  - **Why acceptable**: For MVP phase, this is acceptable as weather updates are not critical business operations. Can be mitigated with graceful shutdown handling and quick restart procedures.
- **Limited to single instance deployment**
  - **Why acceptable**: Current scale (10,000 users) doesn't require multiple instances. Can be addressed later with distributed scheduling solutions when scaling to 100,000 users.
- **No built-in monitoring or job history**
  - **Why acceptable**: Can implement basic logging in use case layer. Monitoring can be added incrementally as the system grows.
- **No job prioritization**
  - **Why acceptable**: Weather updates are not time-critical operations. All jobs have equal priority in current business model.
- **Manual error handling required**
  - **Why acceptable**: Errors are infrequent and mostly recoverable (network issues, API limits). Use case layer can handle retry logic.
